# South African Schools App

# Overview
Investigations and explorations into the "master lists" for schools in South Africa. 

Within `/scripts` are the files for `data_prep`, including the geocoding, and the initial data exploration is in a `.Rmd` report.

# Shiny App

The **Shiny App** visualises the locations of the schools, along with additional information, using Leaflet and Open Street Maps.

Explore the map and gain a unique perspective into South Africaâ€™s multifarious, multilayered, multicultural and multicoloured education system.

# Data
The Excel files are from the South African Department of Basic Education [website](www.education.gov.za/Programmes/EMIS/EMISDownloads.aspx) and indicate the state of schools as at March 2017

This is still a work in progress! Feedback and questions welcome.
