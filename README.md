# South African Schools App

# Overview
Investigations and explorations into the "master lists" for schools in South Africa. 

Within `/scripts` are the files for `data_prep`, including the geocoding, and the initial data exploration is in a `.Rmd` report.

The **Shiny App** visualises the locations of the schools, along with addiitonal information, using Leaflet and Open Street Maps.

# Data
The Excel files are from the South African Department of Basic Education Website and indicate the state of schools as at March 2017:

This is still very much a work in progress!
